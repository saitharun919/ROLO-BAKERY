      <span>The company began its journey in 2024 with one small store. In 2024, we now have 3 stores </span>
      <span>locations with many more to come this year. Here at Eggfree Cake Box</span> 
      <span>we like to think of each other as family, and our success is because we have </span>
      <span>held on to our family values. We have extended the family circle to include our customers.</span>
      <span>To us the customer is not somebody who simply buys a cake from one of our stores. When we make a cake </span>
      <span>for somebody’s special occasion, we know that we are being allowed into the person’s family via</span>
      <span> the cake. That is why each cake is baked and decorated as if it was meant for a member of </span>
      <span>one of our families.</span>
      <span>We pride ourselves in using the finest quality ingredients, and taking the upmost </span>
      <span>care in the production of our cakes. It is a great honour for us to share our customers’ </span>
      <span>most important occasions, and we pride ourselves in delivering first-rate customer service </span>
      <span>as well as delicious and beautiful cakes.</span>
